is reference implementation formula mathematically correct?

Maybe Aij in modularity computation can be zero...
This would explain both why:
	- my computed modularity differed from reference
	- it's necessary to use a formula like the reference implementation one for efficiency
	
if Aij can be zero in modularity computation (which means unlinked pair of edges are considered), this means that:
	- computing modularity using the original formula takes O(n^2)
	- the reference implementation formula is correct (which means that even if internal weight of a community is zero we still need to account for the negative term - sum_tot ^ 2 / double_m)
